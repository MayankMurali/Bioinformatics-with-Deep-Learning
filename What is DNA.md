# What is DNA ? 

DNA is is a biological representation of a living organism in terms of A,C,G,T which constitute the chromosome.

# What is Genome ?

Genome is a super-set of DNA, that is, its the complete collection of the DNA of the livin organism.

# What is Genetics?

So, genome biologically defines a living organim interms of "traits". The understanding and study of the variations of traits among the living organism is my understanding of the term genetics.


Lets move into applications related to genetics.

I am excited !!

# Population Genetics

With 7.7 billion people in the world, everyone having a different genomic structure, its becomes interesting to study and understand the human evolution. Meanwhile, estimated population of ants in the whole world is 10-100 quadrillion. Its crazy to even think about how many other living organisms exist and how thier DNA structures evolved.

Computing the genomic data is huge task, expecially if you want to study their variation. This is population gentics and its a big application that can be computed with the help of Deep Learning. If you know deep-learning, then you know the crazy things it can do.
